> ### {% icon details %} HISAT2
>
> HISAT2 is a alignment based mapper for NGS-reads. It builds several Hierarchical  Graph Ferragina-Manzini index (HGFM). A FM-index is based on the Burrows-Wheeler transformation and helps to compress but also permitts a fast substring queries.
> Two typs of indexes are build: the whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and many local GFM indexes. The FM indexes are build for rapid extensions of these alignment. 
> You can use a build-in genome or add a genome from your history in fasta fromat. HISAT2 performs that a counting at gene-level.
