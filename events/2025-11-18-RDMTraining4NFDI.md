# Introduction to Galaxy

Researchers who want to follow good scientific practice and research data management are often confronted with high software costs, a lack of programming skills, and limited computing resources. 
One solution to address all these problems is Galaxy, an open source data analysis platform, supporting researchers from diverse domains, including the  Humanities. 

Galaxy enables the automated documentation and execution of scientific analyses and workflows, allowing users to share (partial) results of both the analysis and workflow with just a few clicks. 
Workflows are easily adaptable and can be repeated with different parameters, facilitating FAIR research data management. 
The Galaxy Training Network, with over 400 tutorials, also offers open educational resources that can be used for both independent learning and teaching. 
Thanks to its modular design, Galaxy offers broad application potential across various disciplines and supports easier Research Data Management. All this from within the browser.


## Learning Outcome


By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
- Perform a complete analysis workflow in Galaxy, from data upload to results interpretation.
- Explain how Galaxy supports good Research Data Management (RDM) practices, and apply these principles in their own analyses.
- Understanding the Galaxy training network Create and publish FAIR-compliant learning materials.


## Schedule
